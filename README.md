# DarkMatterWidthCalculator

        Calculates the total width for s-channel mediated dark matter:
        q              dark matter
         \\   med.   //
           ========== 
         //          \\
        q              dark matter
        Gamma_min = Gamma_DM + sum_q Gamma_qq

        type: indicates whether the mediator has vector or axial-vector symmetry
        gQ: coupling of mediator to quarks
        gDM: coupling of mediator to dark matter
        mMed: mass of mediator in GeV
        mDM: mass of dark matter in GeV
